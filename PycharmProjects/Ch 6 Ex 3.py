# Take the following Python code that stores a string:
# str = 'X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475â€™
# Use find and string slicing to extract the portion of the string after the colon character
# and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.

string = "X-DSPAM-Confidence:0.8475"

fin = string.find(":")

portion = string[fin+1:]
print(portion)

convert = float(portion)
print(type(convert))
